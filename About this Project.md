# About This Project

## **E-Library Management System Portal - Introduction**

The Library Management System (LMS) is a web-based application developed using PHP and MySQL. The primary aim of this project is to digitize and streamline the daily operations of a library, making it easier to manage and maintain records. Unlike conventional library management systems, this project offers advanced features like user and admin login facilities.

Through the admin login, the administrator can monitor and manage the entire system, ensuring smooth operations. Students, after logging in, can view a list of books they've borrowed, along with details such as issue dates and return dates.

This system improves the overall library experience by allowing efficient tracking and management of books and student activities.
